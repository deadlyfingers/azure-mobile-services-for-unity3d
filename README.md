# (Deprecated) Mobile Services for Unity3d

The changes in this fork were merged into the main [BitRave repo](https://github.com/bitrave/azure-mobile-services-for-unity3d), but [Mobile services is now Azure App Services](http://www.deadlyfingers.net/azure/azure-app-services-for-unity3d/) so if you want to use the new Azure App Service then try [App Services for Unity](https://github.com/Unity3dAzure/AppServices). A sample project is also available as [App Services demo for Unity](https://github.com/Unity3dAzure/AppServices)
